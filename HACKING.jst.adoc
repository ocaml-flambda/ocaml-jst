= Hacking on ocaml-jst

ocaml-jst has a dune-based build system which is different from
upstream OCaml. To get started, you'll need a working install of OCaml
4.12 and dune, e.g. via OPAM:

    $ opam switch create 4.12.0
    $ eval $(opam env)
    $ opam install dune

You should also install merlin:

    $ opam install merlin

and follow its instructions for how to set up your editor.

Once you have OCaml and dune, you can build and test ocaml-jst with:

    $ ./configure --prefix=/where/to/install
    $ make -f Makefile.jst runtest-upstream

Other useful Makefile targets are:

    $ make -f Makefile.jst compiler

to build without running the testsuite, or:

    $ make -f Makefile.jst hacking

to start a continuously polling build of the compiler.

Note that the dune-based build system is entirely separate from the main
Makefile, and so you will need to use `make -f Makefile.jst install` 
to install after building.
